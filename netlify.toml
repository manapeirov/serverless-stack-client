# "base" is directory to change to before starting build. It's directory where Netlify will run our build commands. In our case it is in the project root. So this is left empty.
# "publish" is the directory to publish (relative to root of your repo). The publish option points to where our build is generated. In the case of Create React App it is the build directory in our project root.
# "command" is your build command. The build command that Netlify will use.
